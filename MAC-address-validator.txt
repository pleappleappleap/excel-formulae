This formula makes sure that there are six pairs of hexadecimal digits between
five colons.  It does this by extracting each pair by character position, and
converting them from hex to decimal, and making sure it's a number.  Then it
makes sure it has five colons by removing all colons from the data and
comparing the size to ensure it has been reduced by 5, the total number of
colons.

It's quite useful to add this formula as a custom data validator to cells that
should contain MAC addresses.  This formula has been written to be short enough
to fit within the maximum length of the data validator formula field.
